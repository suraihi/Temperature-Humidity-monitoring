# 1.0 Problem Statment
There’s a delicate balance when it comes to your indoor space’s temperature and humidity levels. Ideally, your indoor air will vary between 20ºC to 25ºC, and 30% to 50% relative humidity.

Indoor environments that are too hot can lead to a variety of health risks, including heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and feelings of lethargy. In fact, the difference between 20ºC and 28ºC can result in a 15% decline in workplace productivity. In extreme cases, sustained exposure to extreme heat can lead to increased illnesses and hospitalization. On the other hand, a space that’s too cold can result in higher blood pressure, asthma, and poor mental health. Viruses are also more likely to survive and spread in cool, dry indoor conditions.

In addition to viral infections and respiratory illnesses, an overly dry environment can also contribute to skin problems, nosebleeds, and sore throats. But increase the humidity in a building, and your space will become damp. This can make it susceptible to mold, which is often associated with breathing issues.

As climate change persists, it’s more important than ever for landlords and business owners to consider the impacts of seasonal heat waves and cold fronts in order to keep their tenants and employees safe. Electronic equipment, exterior building construction, window composition, lack of airflow, and certain industrial practices may also play a part into your space’s temperature and humidity levels.

Most buildings don’t have the ability to widely track temperature and humidity, with readings being confined to a single heating zone. A system that includes a temperature and humidity monitor can help you uncover areas that are too hot, cold, or humid in more detail. This can help you prevent your occupants from being exposed to dangerous indoor environments that could lead to serious health issues.


# 2.0 System Arctitecture 

This section present an overview of the system architecture of IoT Temperature-Humidity-monitoring system 
our system architecture will be divided on three main sections
- Sensor and device
- Cloud platform using Django Rest Framework and Python Everywhere
- Dashboard

# 3.0 Sensors
-  ESP32

# 4.0 Cloud Platform

Cloud Platform
In order to transfer data between all the hardware components and people smart phones, we need to set up a cloud platform. We will update the cloud platform in real time data as the cars get in and out the parking slots. We also need to get the data from the loud platform and present them to the people in our Dashboard. 
A server is created using Django with python. As we learnt from stage one, we created a new unique server for our project using ubuntu. Django in python was a great option. Then we will push the server project files into GITHUB to share and edit them all together  
To send our web pages online we need to use one of the hosting providers online, PythonAnywhere is a great one.
